# PF Combat

## About
This app is designed to make running Pathfinder games in the meat space
a bit easier. Initially it will just be a fancy initiative and hitpoint
tracker. Down the road I hope to implement condition tracking, a dice
roller and maybe more.

## Background
I wrote this app as a way to start learning
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I needed a way into web app
development and I knew React was it. If you look over the code, be
warned, since I was using this as a learning experience I did not hold
the code to the kind of standards I usually do. The code is a mess and
there isn't any hint of an automated test.
